Sem Project Topic - SmartHire : Ai Interview Platform
Abstract

The recruitment landscape is rapidly evolving with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies aimed at streamlining and enhancing the hiring process. *SmartHire* is an AI-powered interview platform developed to automate and optimize the preliminary stages of recruitment. The objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable and intelligent system capable of conducting interviews, evaluating candidate responses, and generating real-time feedback, thereby reducing human bias and saving valuable time for hiring managers.

The SmartHire platform leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to assess candidate responses in both audio and text formats. The system is trained to analyze various parameters such as grammar, tone, clarity, confidence, and relevance of the answers. It also includes a scoring mechanism that ranks candidates based on customizable criteria defined by employers. The user interface is designed to be intuitive for both candidates and recruiters, with features such as question bank customization, real-time analytics, and automated shortlisting.

The project uses Python and frameworks like Flask for backend development, along with AI models integrated via APIs. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience. Database management is handled through MySQL for storing candidate profiles, interview data, and analytics.

SmartHire represents a step forward in digital recruitment solutions by providing an efficient, unbiased, and consistent interview experience. It significantly reduces the workload on HR departments and ensures that only the most suitable candidates proceed to the final stages of hiring. Future enhancements may include integration with video analysis for facial expression recognition and multilingual support.
