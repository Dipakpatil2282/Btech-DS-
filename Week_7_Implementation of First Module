Week_7_Implementation of First Module

The first module implemented in the Smart Hire AI: Interview Platform focuses on Job Role and Question Set Configuration. This module is critical because it lays the foundation for a personalized, role-specific interview experience. The primary objective of this module is to allow recruiters to input the details of a vacant position and automatically generate a tailored set of questions aligned with the job requirements. This ensures that the interview process is structured, relevant, and comprehensive.
The implementation began with the development of a user-friendly recruiter interface using HTML5, CSS3, and React.js. The interface includes a form where recruiters can enter job-related information such as Job Title, Department, Key Skills, Required Experience, Educational Qualifications, and Preferred Candidate Attributes. To make the form dynamic and efficient, we incorporated form validation techniques that prevent incomplete or invalid entries.

We also integrated dropdown menus and auto-suggestions using JavaScript to enhance usability.Once the recruiter submits the job details, the data is passed to the backend server built with Python (Flask framework). In the backend, the system maps the input fields to a predefined knowledge base that contains categorized question banks. These question banks were manually curated and stored in a structured database (MySQL) during the system setup. Each job role in the database is linked with technical, behavioral, and situational questions designed to assess both hard and soft skills.
An algorithm was implemented to dynamically select questions based on the job requirements. For example, if a recruiter mentions "Python programming" as a required skill, the system retrieves technical questions focusing on Python basics, advanced concepts, and problem-solving scenarios. Similarly, for soft skills like "team management," behavioral questions related to leadership and conflict resolution are selected. If the recruiter chooses "custom mode," they can manually add or modify questions from a suggested list.
To further personalize the interview, we added a feature that allows setting the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) and format type (text, audio, or video response) for each question. This ensures that candidates are tested appropriately for the level of the role they are applying for. Each question stored in the database has associated metadata such as skill category, difficulty level, question type, and expected answer keywords, which helps in efficient retrieval and evaluation later.
Security was also considered in this module's implementation. 

User inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks, and data is transmitted over secure HTTPS protocols.The entire process is designed to be scalable so that recruiters can manage multiple job postings simultaneously without system overload.
The success of this first module sets a strong foundation for the Smart Hire AI platform. It ensures that subsequent modules — such as candidate response collection, AI evaluation, and recruiter dashboard — operate on a robust and well-structured base. By automating the job role configuration and dynamic question generation, this module significantly reduces manual work for recruiters and ensures a standardized yet flexible interview structure tailored to each hiring need.
