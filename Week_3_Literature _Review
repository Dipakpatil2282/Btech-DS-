WEEK_3_Literature_Review

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recruitment has gained significant attention in recent years, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional hiring practices. Various studies and research papers highlight that conventional recruitment methods are time-consuming, prone to human bias, and often inconsistent due to subjective evaluation. As organizations grow and remote work becomes more prevalent, there is a growing need for automated systems that can manage large volumes of candidates efficiently.
According to a report by LinkedIn, more than 67% of hiring professionals believe AI has helped improve the hiring process by reducing screening time and identifying suitable candidates faster. Researchers have explored the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze resumes, conduct interviews, and assess candidate responses based on language patterns, tone, and content relevance. Sentiment analysis, a subdomain of NLP, is widely used to interpret emotional cues, which helps assess a candidate’s confidence and communication style during interviews.
Several platforms, such as HireVue and Pymetrics, have implemented AI-based interviewing systems that use facial recognition, voice analysis, and response scoring to evaluate candidates. However, many existing systems have been criticized for lacking transparency and reinforcing bias if not trained on diverse datasets. This underlines the need for ethical, explainable AI models that can offer fair and consistent evaluations.
Academic literature also emphasizes the role of AI in enabling structured interviews and real-time feedback, which helps standardize the process and support better decision-making by HR professionals. Research further suggests that AI can significantly reduce hiring time and improve the quality of hires, especially during initial screening phases.
In conclusion, the literature supports the potential of AI-driven platforms in transforming recruitment, and this project aims to build upon these findings to develop an efficient, fair, and scalable interview system through Smart Hire AI.

Review_Of_Existing_System:

In recent years, several AI-powered recruitment platforms have emerged to assist organizations in streamlining the hiring process. These existing systems aim to reduce human effort, eliminate bias, and enhance efficiency through automation. However, while they offer several advantages, they also have certain limitations that leave room for improvement, which our proposed system – Smart Hire AI – aims to address.
One of the most widely known platforms is HireVue, which uses AI to analyze video interviews. It evaluates facial expressions, tone of voice, word choice, and speaking pace to generate an overall candidate score. Although HireVue is effective in handling large volumes of applicants and provides objective scoring, it has faced criticism regarding transparency and potential bias in its facial analysis algorithms.
Pymetrics is another platform that uses neuroscience-based games and AI to assess personality traits and cognitive skills. While it offers a unique and engaging candidate experience, it may not always align with the specific technical or communication requirements of a job role.
MyInterview provides video-based asynchronous interviews and uses AI to assess candidates on various behavioral metrics. However, its analytical depth is limited, and it primarily focuses on entry-level or customer-facing roles.
Spark Hire and VidCruiter are also popular platforms that facilitate one-way video interviews and offer structured evaluation frameworks. These platforms, while efficient in remote hiring, still rely heavily on manual recruiter involvement for final decision-making and lack comprehensive AI-driven insights.
Most of these systems offer either limited technical evaluation capabilities or generic scoring models that may not fully capture a candidate’s potential, especially in specialized or high-skill roles. Moreover, ethical concerns regarding data privacy, transparency, and model bias continue to challenge the acceptance of AI in hiring.
In conclusion, while existing systems provide a strong foundation for AI-based hiring, there remains a need for a more flexible, transparent, and intelligent solution—such as Smart Hire AI—that offers customizable question sets, deep analysis, real-time feedback, and fair evaluation across diverse job roles.
