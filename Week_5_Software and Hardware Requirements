Week_5_Software and Hardware Requirements

1. Software Requirements
The Smart Hire AI platform integrates front-end and back-end development with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and cloud technologies. Below are the required software components:

a. Programming Languages & Frameworks

•	Frontend:
o	HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
o	React.js or Angular (for dynamic UI)

•	Backend:
o	Python (for AI/ML processing and backend logic)
o	Node.js (optional, for REST APIs)

b. Libraries and APIs

•	NLP & AI Analysis:
o	NLTK, SpaCy, or Transformers (for text analysis)
o	OpenCV or DeepFace (for facial expression detection)
o	TextBlob / Vader (for sentiment analysis)
o	Google Speech-to-Text API or CMU Sphinx (for audio transcription)

•	Machine Learning:
o	Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch

•	Database:
o	MySQL or MongoDB (to store user and candidate data)

•	Authentication & Security:
o	JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
o	OAuth 2.0 (optional for social login or admin access)

c. Development Tools
•	IDE: Visual Studio Code / PyCharm
•	Version Control: Git, GitHub or GitLab
•	Containerization (optional): Docker
•	Deployment: Heroku / AWS / Google Cloud Platform (for hosting web app and AI services)

d. Operating System
•	Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04+, or macOS (for development)


2. Hardware Requirements
The hardware requirements depend on whether the application is being used for development, testing, or deployment. Here's a typical setup:

a. For Development (Local Machine)
•	Processor: Intel i5 or higher (or AMD equivalent)
•	RAM: Minimum 8 GB (16 GB recommended for AI/ML model training)
•	Storage: Minimum 256 GB SSD
•	GPU: NVIDIA GPU (recommended for training heavy AI models; optional if using cloud-based training)

b. For Server/Deployment (Cloud or On-Premises)
•	CPU: 4-core or higher (cloud instance like AWS EC2 t2.medium or above)
•	RAM: Minimum 8 GB
•	Storage: 100 GB SSD (expandable based on dataset size)
•	GPU (optional): NVIDIA T4/RTX GPU for intensive video/audio processing

c. End User Requirements
•	Browser: Latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
•	Camera & Microphone: Required for video/audio interviews
•	Internet: Stable connection (minimum 2 Mbps upload/download speed)

This combination of software and hardware ensures that Smart Hire AI runs efficiently, supports real-time data processing, and delivers a seamless user experience for both recruiters and candidates.
